# PospectingWebApplication(Frontend+Backend)
 This is my frontend backend code for my hockey prospecting site

Heres a list of features I plan on including:

1. **Prospect Development Tracker**:
   - Create a system that tracks the development of prospects over time, including stats, performance reviews, and video highlights.
   - Include a "Growth Projection" feature that uses machine learning to predict future performance based on current trends and historical data.

2. **Interactive Draft Simulator**:
   - Allow users to simulate their own draft scenarios, making choices for different teams and seeing how those choices play out over multiple seasons.
   - Incorporate advanced analytics to provide feedback on draft choices and suggest potential trades or picks.

3. **Player Comparison Tool**:
   - Develop a feature that allows users to compare prospects side-by-side, with in-depth metrics, scouting reports, and historical comparisons to current NHL players.
   - Include visualizations like radar charts, heat maps, and career trajectory graphs.

4. **Community Scouting Reports**:
   - Enable users to submit their own scouting reports and ratings for prospects. Highlight top contributors and create a reputation system.
   - Integrate a voting or commenting system to encourage community interaction and engagement.

5. **Prospect News Aggregator**:
   - Aggregate news articles, social media posts, and forum discussions related to hockey prospects in one place.
   - Use natural language processing to summarize and highlight key insights from various sources.

6. **Prospect Fantasy Leagues**:
   - Create a fantasy league system focused specifically on prospects, where users draft and manage a team of up-and-coming players.
   - Include unique scoring categories that reflect prospect development and potential.

7. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Offer detailed analytics and visualizations for prospects, including advanced stats like Corsi, Fenwick, and expected goals.
   - Provide customizable dashboards where users can track specific players or teams of interest.

8. **Player Interview Library**:
   - Curate a library of interviews with prospects, scouts, and coaches, giving users deeper insights into player personalities and work ethics.
   - Include video content and transcription with key highlights.

9. **Historical Draft Analysis**:
   - Analyze past drafts to identify trends, successes, and busts. Provide insights into which teams have been most successful in drafting and developing talent.
   - Offer interactive tools that let users explore "what-if" scenarios for past drafts.

10. **Mobile App Integration**:
    - Develop a companion mobile app with push notifications for prospect updates, draft alerts, and community interactions.
